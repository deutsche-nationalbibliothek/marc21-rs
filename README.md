# marc21

This project provides a toolkit for efficiently processing bibliographic
records encoded in [MARC21], which is a popular file format used to
exchange bibliographic data between libraries. In particular, the
command line tool `marc21` allows efficient filtering of records and
extraction of data into a rectangular schema. Since the extracted data
is in tabular form, it can be processed with popular frameworks such as
[Polars] ([Python]) or [Tidyverse] ([R]).
